## VR Lab: 00

I have tried the Oculus Quest in lab in which I played Virtual Virtual Reality, Job Simulator, the Vader Immortal: Episode 1, and Oculus First Contact. I enjoyed the games as they didn't have many movement which would cause motion sickness.

In Class 9/18
I started learning how to use some of the already made VR scripts from the farmland. However, I'm still having difficulties figuring out how to use it.

Lab01 Interactions and Intentions
In order to complete the level, you must carry the two chickens to the hen house and the goat to red pen. I wanted a simple interactions in which users can get a feel for carrying objects and placing them on correct locations which will advance the level. I downloaded a chicken and goat model from the asset store.
