Lab02

So for my lab02, I place several chess pieces into my plane for my AR experience. In theory,
it's possible to create a chess game entirely through VR. The user can use their phones to
show a chessboard on a plane and slide their pieces using their finger. The AR system is able to detect
flat surfaces and detecting user inputs so I believe that it's possible to create the game.
